### [PLAY IT HERE!](https://mattbruv.github.io/pokered.ts/)

pokered.ts is a (work in progress) implementation of Pokemon Red written entirely in TypeScript.

The game is written with standard web technologies such as HTML Canvas and other native browser technologies
and satisfies [Atwood's Law](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Atwood%27s_Law).

Note: This project is \*NOT\* emulation. There is no emulation of the GameBoy's hardware, nor is the original game's code present or emulated in any fashion.
